Basic Searches and Counting
1. Count Total Lines: How many total lines are in the play text?
wc -l hamlet.txt

How many total lines are in hamlet.txt? >> 81
How many total lines are in hamlet2.txt? >> 46
2. Case-Insensitive Search: How many times does the word "hamlet" appear anywhere in the text?
grep -ic 'hamlet' hamlet.txt

How many times does 'hamlet' appear in hamlet.txt? >> 7
How many times does 'hamlet' appear in hamlet2.txt?  >> 2
3. Excluding Text: How many lines in the play do not contain the word "hamlet"?
grep -iv 'hamlet' hamlet.txt | wc -l

How many lines in the play do not contain the word "hamlet" in hamlet.txt? >> 75
How many lines in the play do not contain the word "hamlet" in hamlet2.txt? >> 45
4. Line Numbers: Display all lines where the word "father" appears, including the line number for context.
grep -n 'father' hamlet.txt

Copy output from the above search
18:Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
40:To give these mourning duties to your father:
41:But, you must know, your father lost a father;
42:That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
56:Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
60:As of a father: for let the world take note,

Part B: Advanced Pattern Matching and Processing
5. Counting Specific Dialogue: How many times does the character HAMLET speak (i.e., how many lines start with HAMLET: )?
grep -c '^HAMLET:' hamlet.txt

'^' anchor matches only the start of the line.

The number of times HAMLET speaks in hamlet.txt is  >> 3
6. Print all lines to the screen in which HAMLET speaks in hamlet.txt:
HAMLET: Ay, madam, it is common.
HAMLET: Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not 'seems.'
HAMLET: God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man


7. How many times does the character POLONIUS speak in hamlet2.txt?

The number of times POLONIUS speaks in hamlet2.txt is  >> 3
8. Print all lines to the screen in which POLONIUS speaks in hamlet2.txt:
POLONIUS: Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
POLONIUS: What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
POLONIUS: Marry, well bethought:

9. Counting Unique Speakers: Generate a list of all unique characters who speak in the play.
# 1. Use the pattern to find all lines starting with a speaker name and colon.
# 2. Cut out the speaker name (field 1, using ':' as the delimiter).
# 3. Sort the names to group duplicates together.
# 4. Use uniq to count the unique instances.

grep '^[^ ]*:' hamlet.txt | cut -d':' -f1 | sort | uniq

This pipeline first uses grep with a regular expression to extract all speaker names and colons, then cut isolates the names. The output is finally processed by sort and uniq to produce a definitive list of every unique character who delivers dialogue in the play.

This expression '^[^ ]*:'ensures the line represents a character speaking, not just a reference to a character.

    ^ Anchors the match to the start of the line.

    [^ ]* Matches any number of characters that are NOT a space (this captures the speaker's name, which often has no spaces).

    : Matches the literal colon, which definitively separates the speaker's name from their dialogue in the play's format.

Copy/Paste the print of all unique speakers in hamlet.txt

HAMLET
KING
OPHELIA
POLONIUS
QUEEN


10. Copy/Paste the print of all unique speakers in hamlet2.txt

LAERTES
OPHELIA
POLONIUS


11. Adapt the command in #9 above to only output the number of unique speakers, instead of the list of speakers.  What command would do this

grep '^[^ ]*:' hamlet.txt | cut -d':' -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
12. Specific Word Count in a Character's Dialogue: How many times does a character use specific words?
# 1. Filter the entire file to only include HAMLET's lines.
# 2. Pipe that output to a new grep command that counts the occurrences of "madam".

grep '^HAMLET:' hamlet.txt | grep -io 'madam' | wc -l

How many of HAMLET's lines include also the word 'madam'  in hamlet.txt?  >> 2
How many of LAERTES's lines include also the word 'Farewell'  in hamlet2.txt?  >> 2

13. Finding Consecutive Vowels (Extended Regex): Find lines that contain three or more vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appearing consecutively. (Hint: Use grep -E for the + quantifier.)
grep -E '[aeiou]{3,}' hamlet.txt


QUEEN: Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
QUEEN: If it be,
Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage,
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;


Note: last 3 in yellow using: grep -E '[aeiou]{3,}' hamlet.txt
But for all including capital letters use: grep -E '[aeiouAEIOU]{3,}' hamlet.txt or grep -Ei '[aeiou]{3,}' hamlet.txt



Using Both Files: What follows are two examples that use both hamlet.txt (the first file) and hamlet2.txt (the second file) in interesting ways, focusing on counting and context.
14: Comparing Character Dialogue Counts: This example uses both files to find the total number of lines spoken by a major character (HAMLET) versus a minor character (LAERTES), demonstrating the power of piping output to wc -l (word count - line count).
Goal: Count the total number of dialogue lines spoken by Hamlet across both files, and compare it to the total number of lines spoken by Laertes.
Search Goal
Command
Explanation
Count Hamlet's Lines
grep -cE '^HAMLET:' hamlet*.txt
-c (Count): Suppresses normal output and prints only the count of matched lines. -E (Extended Regex): Allows us to use the ^ anchor to ensure we match lines where "HAMLET" is the speaker, not just a word in someone else's speech.
Count Laertes's Lines
grep -cE '^LAERTES:' hamlet2.txt
Since Laertes only appears in the second file, we can limit the search to hamlet2.txt for efficiency, although searching both would also work.

This shows how to use the ^ (caret) anchor and the powerful -c flag to quickly quantify data across a large set of text files.
Using the above commands, answer the following questions:
The total number of dialogue lines spoken by Hamlet across both files is >> 123
[The total number of dialogue lines spoken by Laertes in hamlet2.txt is >> 12]  didn’t ask but here is the answer.




15: Finding Interjections and Context Across Scenes: This example uses a common word or phrase to pull its surrounding context from both files, which is useful when tracking an idea or looking for similar language used in different parts of the play.
Goal: Find every instance where the word "father" or "friend" is mentioned across both files, and display the two lines immediately surrounding the match to understand the context of the relationship being discussed.

Command
Explanation
Search for Family Mentions with Context
grep -iEC 2 '(father|friend)' hamlet*.txt
-i (Ignore Case): Matches Father, father, Friend, etc. -C 2 (Context): Tells grep to print 2 lines of context before and after the matching line. Extended Regex (A|B): Matches either "father" OR "friend" in a single search, using parentheses for grouping.

Context (-C): This is a critical flag for log file analysis or code review, as simply knowing a word exists isn't enough; you need the lines around it to understand the flow.
Multiple Files: By using hamlet*.txt, grep automatically includes the file name in the output for each match, letting you immediately know if the line came from the first or second excerpt.
Or Logic (\|): Demonstrates how to search for multiple patterns simultaneously, making the search far more efficient than running two separate commands.
16) What command could you use to determine the number of lines that include the words "father/friend" across both files?
grep -E 'father|friend' hamlet*.txt | wc -l
grep -Ei 'father|friend' hamlet*.txt | wc -l   for all case-insensitive



17) What is the number of lines that include the word "father" across both files?
The number of lines that include the word "father" across both files is >> 6
18) What is the number of lines that include the word "father or friend" across both files?
The number of lines that include the word "father" or "friend" across both files is >> 45

So github codespace + vsc is a nightmare!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I did the entire lab and there is nothing to commit or push
I however saved everything in a word doc.  CAUCHMAR
